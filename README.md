Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.
=============================================================================

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework and it's specially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

*NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.*

raylib does not provide the typical API documentation or a big set of tutorials. The library is designed to be minimalistic and be learned just from a cheatsheet with all required functionality and a big collection of examples to see how to use that functionality. **Best way to learn to code is reading code.**
